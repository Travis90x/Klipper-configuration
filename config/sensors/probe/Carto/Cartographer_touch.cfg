speed: 40. #   Z probing dive speed.
lift_speed: 5.0 #   Z probing lift speed.

# 
#   Offsets are measured from the centre of your coil, to the tip of your nozzle 
#   on a level axis. It is vital that this is accurate. 
#

x_offset: 0                          
#    adjust for your cartographers offset from nozzle to middle of coil
y_offset: 15                         
#    adjust for your cartographers offset from nozzle to middle of coil

#   Backlash compensation distance for removing Z backlash before measuring
#   the sensor response.
backlash_comp: 0.5



trigger_distance: 2.0 #   cartographer trigger distance for homing.
trigger_dive_threshold: 1.5 #   Threshold for range vs dive mode probing. Beyond `trigger_distance + trigger_dive_threshold` a dive will be used.
trigger_hysteresis: 0.006 #   Hysteresis on trigger threshold for untriggering, as a percentage of the trigger threshold.
cal_nozzle_z: 0.1 #   Expected nozzle offset after completing manual Z offset calibration.
cal_floor: 0.1 #   Minimum z bound on sensor response measurement.
cal_ceil: 5.0 #   Maximum z bound on sensor response measurement.
cal_speed: 1.0 #   Speed while measuring response curve.
cal_move_speed: 10.0 #   Speed while moving to position for response curve measurement.

default_model_name: default #   Name of default cartographer model to load.

calibration_method: touch
#    leave this as touch unless you want to use scan only for everything. 
sensor: cartographer
#    this must be set as cartographer unless using IDM etc.
sensor_alt: carto
#    alternate name to call commands. CARTO_TOUCH etc
scanner_touch_z_offset: 0.05         
#    This is the default and will be overwritten and added to the DO NOT SAVE area by using UI to save z offset

mesh_main_direction: x #   Primary travel direction during mesh measurement.
# mesh_overscan: -1 #   Distance to use for direction changes at mesh line ends. Omit this setting and a default will be calculated from line spacing and available travel.
mesh_cluster_size: 1 #   Radius of mesh grid point clusters.
mesh_runs: 2
#    Number of passes to make during mesh scan.
